```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries and set global chunk options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)   # For data wrangling and visualization
library(lubridate)   # For handling date/time formats
library(hms)         # For parsing time
```


```{r}
# Load the data directly from the NYC Open Data URL (updated quarterly)
url <- "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

# Read the CSV into R
shootings_raw <- read_csv(url)

# Preview the structure of the raw data
glimpse(shootings_raw)
```

```{r}
# Step 1: Clean column names (lowercase and remove spaces)
shootings_clean <- shootings_raw %>%
  rename_with(~ str_replace_all(., "\\s+", "_")) %>%
  rename_with(~ str_to_lower(.))

# Step 2: Convert appropriate columns to correct types
# Dates (use correct format as in the actual data)
# Times (hms() parses HH:MM:SS format)
# Factors for categorical fields

shootings_clean <- shootings_clean %>%
  mutate(
    occur_date = mdy(occur_date),                      # Convert date
    occur_time = parse_time(as.character(occur_time)), # Convert time safely
    boro = as.factor(boro),
    location_desc = as.factor(location_desc),
    perp_sex = as.factor(perp_sex),
    perp_race = as.factor(perp_race),
    vic_sex = as.factor(vic_sex),
    vic_race = as.factor(vic_race)
  )

# Step 3: Drop columns not needed for analysis
# Adjust the columns based on your analysis goals

shootings_clean <- shootings_clean %>%
  select(
    occur_date, occur_time, boro, precinct, location_desc,
    perp_sex, perp_race, vic_sex, vic_race,
    latitude, longitude
  )
```

```{r}
# Summarize number of missing values per column
missing_summary <- shootings_clean %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "variable", values_to = "missing_count") %>%
  arrange(desc(missing_count))

# Display missing data summary
missing_summary
```

```{r}
# Plan:
# - Drop rows where key analysis variables are missing: boro, occur_date
# - Retain rows with missing perp info (often not available for open cases)

shootings_final <- shootings_clean %>%
  drop_na(occur_date, boro)

# Recheck summary to confirm data integrity
summary(shootings_final)
```

This breakdown shows racial disparities in who is affected 
by shootings across different boroughs. 
Certain groups appear to be disproportionately affected depending on location. 
This raises questions about underlying systemic
or community-level factors contributing to violence.

```{r plot-location-type, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Count the number of shootings by location type
shootings_final %>%
  filter(!is.na(location_desc)) %>%
  count(location_desc, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 10) %>%  # Show top 10 most common locations
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(location_desc, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#2c7fb8") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Locations of Shooting Incidents in NYC",
       x = "Location Type",
       y = "Number of Incidents") +
  theme_minimal()
```
This chart reveals where shootings most often take place.
These trends can reflect patterns in public safety, housing, 
or neighborhood infrastructure and may help city agencies 
prioritize patrols or interventions.


```{r plot-hourly-shootings, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Extract hour from time of day
shootings_final <- shootings_final %>%
  mutate(hour = hour(occur_time))  # lubridate::hour()

# Plot number of incidents by hour (0–23)
shootings_final %>%
  count(hour) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = n)) +
  geom_line(color = "#d73027", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(color = "black", size = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:23) +
  labs(title = "Shooting Incidents by Hour of Day",
       x = "Hour (24-Hour Format)",
       y = "Number of Incidents") +
  theme_minimal()
```
There is often see a sharp increase in the evening and night 
(between 8 PM and 2 AM).
Less incidents occur in the early morning (3–7 AM), when less people are active.



Conclusion: 
This analysis of the NYPD Shooting Incident Data highlighted key trends, 
such as the peak of incidents occurring during late evening and night, 
with most shootings taking place in public spaces like streets. 
The findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions
in high-risk areas and times.

However, potential biases exist in the data, such as underreporting, 
geographical discrepancies, and incomplete demographic information. 
As the analyst, I recognize my personal biases shaped by societal 
narratives and have mitigated them by focusing on data-driven 
findings and maintaining objectivity throughout the process.

Further research could expand this analysis to include socio-economic 
factors and explore the impact of police presence, offering 
deeper insights into the factors contributing to urban crime.
